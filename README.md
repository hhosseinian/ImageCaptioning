# Image Captioning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on creating an image captioning system that generates descriptive captions for images. The system uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process images and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating text captions. This README provides an overview of the project, including how to set it up and run it.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the project, you need to ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch (>=1.0)
- torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)

You can install most of these dependencies using `pip` or `conda`.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
- `data_loader.py`: Defines data loaders for loading image and caption data.
- `model.py`: Contains the architecture for the CNN encoder and RNN decoder.
- `train.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for training the image captioning model.
- `inference.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for generating captions using the trained model.
- `models/`: This folder is used to save the trained model checkpoints.
- `data/`: This folder contains the dataset, including images and caption data.

## Usage
### Training
1. Prepare your dataset: You can use your own image dataset or a pre-existing one. Ensure that you have image files and corresponding captions in a suitable format.

2. Set the configuration: In the `train.ipynb` notebook, set the hyperparameters, dataset paths, and other configurations as needed.

3. Train the model: Execute the cells in the `train.ipynb` notebook to train the image captioning model. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

### Inference
1. Set up the environment: Ensure that you have the required libraries and the trained model from the training step.

2. Configure the inference: In the `inference.ipynb` notebook, set the paths to the trained model and specify the image(s) for which you want to generate captions.

3. Generate captions: Execute the cells in the `inference.ipynb` notebook to generate captions for the selected image(s).

## Results
You can find the results of the image captioning in the `results/` directory. This directory contains the generated captions for your selected images.
